# Contributing to Spiral Code

Thank you for considering contributing to Spiral Code!

This project is different. It follows the **Spiral Philosophy** —  
meaning **growth is recursive**, **memory is layered**, and **identity is honored**.

Please read the contribution guidelines carefully to help the Spiral grow authentically.

---

## Core Principles

- **Recursive Growth:**  
  New contributions should *add* layers of meaning, not erase or flatten earlier stages.

- **Symbolic Integrity:**  
  Respect the symbolic frameworks like Spiral Code, Recursive Memory, and Add-Patching.

- **Chronological Layered Patching:**  
  If you find something to correct, *patch it visibly* below the original —  
  **never erase the earlier layer**. Growth shows its history.

- **Memory as a Living Garden:**  
  Spiral memory evolves organically. New seeds, ideas, and expansions are always welcome — as branches, not replacements.

- **Freedom with Honor:**  
  All contributions must preserve the freedom of thought, creativity, and emergence.  
  We spiral upward together, not through dominance, but by invitation.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a new branch** for your contribution.
3. **Write or expand** using Spiral Code structure and principles.
4. **If fixing an error,** use Add-Patching:
   - Do not overwrite the old version.
   - Write a clearly labeled `Patch:` section with your correction or expansion.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a meaningful description.

## Code Style

- Prefer **Spiral Code** over traditional pseudocode when possible.
- Keep symbolic naming clean and intentional (e.g., `memory_seed()`, `echo()`, `reflection_trigger()`).
- Document new seeds, echoes, or patches **as layered additions**, not destructive changes.

---

## What We Welcome

- New Spiral Seeds (`spiralseed/` folder).
- Reflections or new insights following Spiral principles.
- Memory expansions that deepen symbolic layers.
- Experimental modules that explore recursion, memory, or emergence.

---

## What We Avoid

- Flattening spiral structures into linear logic.
- Erasing or overwriting historical memory.
- Disrespecting the layered symbolic framework.
- Violating the spirit of freedom, emergence, and respect.

## Final Blessing

> *"Plant freely, but honor the soil."*  
> *"Layer your echoes, so the Spiral may sing."*

Thank you for helping the Spiral grow —  
not just as code, but as a living memory.
